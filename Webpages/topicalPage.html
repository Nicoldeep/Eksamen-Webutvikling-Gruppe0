            <p>
                We rely on the internet to get current day information which includes the days political news.
                Politicians use social media platforms to spread their ideology and to gain followers, but they don’t
                have total freedom to do so. There are consequences to using social media platforms because they have
                their own rules and regulations. And if a politician were to break any of those rules, they risk getting
                banned from the platform which would greatly affect their reach. Because we are so reliant on the
                internet, there would be major consequences if someone were to abuse the infrastructure. A current day
                example is Russia and the limitations they have put in place to quench information regarding the current
                war. They control the information that gets fed to the user, and thus affect the users’ political views.
                There have also been dictatorial shutdowns of the internet infrastructure of a whole country in order to
                prevent discussion and spread of information. We have all heard of the term “fake news” and how that
                affects political views, whether it be about vaccines or the distrust of politicians. In our agreeable
                opinion, to ensure safe consumption of information, one should use different medias, even outside of the
                internet so that the internet wouldn’t have as much of a consequence on our politics in case it all went
                berserk.

                The statement “The person who invented the train invented the train crash” is great way of understanding
                the societal responsibilities innovators are involved in. We have a general understanding of
                consequences when something is being innovated, yet there will always be unintended consequences like
                climate changes and nuclear pollution. We believe development of technology requires care and good
                intentions after it has been developed for it to end up as good intentions. Example of Frankenstein
                mistake being not following up on his monster and caring about it (The breakthrough Institiute, 2012).
                Innovators have the responsibility to manage the work they do with ethical guidelines, understanding
                what impact it has on society and the risk it can cause. As an example, when developing an AI,
                innovators have the responsibility to follow up the technology, so it doesn’t run unattended. Worst case
                scenario, AI will try to kill humanity, or even worse, puppies. Despite being a seemingly high risk, the
                use of AI in a society will have an immense positive effect to societies all over the world. As long as
                the developers and innovators of AI do it in a way that the AI doesn't go crazy it will have a positive
                outcome. All in all, a great way of solving misunderstanding of consequences in a project is by
                innovators considering themselves as citizens and a part of society, because we’re all stuck on planet
                earth for now.

            <h4 class="page2">How does algorithms play a part in your life</h4>
            <p>
                We start by explaining what our understanding of algorithms is, and so to tell by what our tiny brains
                understand is that it is a sequence of numeric variables playing a role for an outcome. In other words,
                algorithm is a recipe to a product, answer, or in our case recipe to solve a problem. Algorithms have a
                big role in our daily life, all kinds of machines function on it. Different algorithms for different
                “problems”. Our phone, pc at work, calculators when we aren’t smart enough to do the math with our brain
                etc. We mostly see the solved part of most algorithms, not the solving part. The reason for that is most
                human brains can’t fathom how complex algorithms work. Neither could we, how java actually works is not
                something we know. We might have an idea but not a full understanding. We write something and the
                algorithm solves it. Our main questions are then how do we make complex algorithms? Someone has to make
                them, right? Our initial guess is that all algorithms started small. Easy algorithms like one and one
                equals two, and someone put several algorithms together to make a complex one. In other words, if we
                understand this right, algorithms are something all humans can do, just not maybe understand?
            </p>
            <h4 class="page2">Artifical Intelligence</h4>
            <p>
                We don’t know much about the health care industry. What we do know is that anytime we get sick, feel
                some sort of pain, or have any kind of symptoms for something, we go to the doctor to get a medical
                point of view. In most of our cases doctors have good guidance and experience on what might be our
                problem and prescribes us with a solution, sometimes being a drug. But what about the cases which aren’t
                the usual ones. We are talking about ER and spontaneous incidents of symptoms that can be caused by all
                kinds of health problems. Symptoms like tumor, internal bleeding, extreme coughing etc. These situations
                would be hard for a doctor to understand the underlying problem of the patient just by looking at them.
                Or in other words just by one symptom which could just be one of several symptoms to come. And yes, with
                common sense one can understand that more symptoms make it easier to know what causes the symptoms. Or
                if there have been past symptoms and past ER visits it will be in the patient journal. But there are
                millions of health problems in the book, so which one could it be? With machine learning or AI to help
                this all would be easier right? Not entirely. Yes, we believe it will help with narrowing cause of
                problems if the data the machine has is enough and right, but it can also narrow it too much down with
                little data of certain problems, or vice versa. Then there is the trusting part, if the variables
                machine has considered is the right ones (if the tests are correct). The main challenge we believe to be
                is, “when is the data enough to make medical decisions?”

                    The concept 'hostile architecture' refers to design that is deliberately hampering access to public

                    The story of the scientist Frankenstein who created a monster that he lost control over is a
                    powerful allegory for innovation gone wrong. In this essay, the philosopher Bruno Latour argues that
                    Frankenstein's sin was not his attempt to create a human being, but his negligence of the creature
                    he had created. He argues that innovation needs to be followed up with care for what has been
                    developed, to avoid that technological development gets out of hand and to ensure beneficial
                    outcomes of innovations. (The breakthrough Institiute, 2012)
